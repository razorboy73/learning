Oxford Debate is a plugin to create Oxford-Style Debates on your WordPress website.

== Description ==

Oxford Debate is a plugin to create Oxford-Style Debates on your WordPress website.

An Oxford-Style debate is a communication process in which participants argue for and against a given topic. According to Wikipedia, physical Oxford-Style debate is a competitive debate format featuring a sharply framed motion that is proposed by one side and opposed by another. A winner is declared in an Oxford-Style debate either by the majority or by which team has swayed more audience members between the two votes. 

The online version of the Oxford-style debates adaptes the physical model and makes it possible to expand the capabilities of both speakers and audience: 


- Moderator propose a topic with two opposite views and stimulate the debate.
- Speakers defense their proposal with argument using web connectivity and multimedia.
- Community can vote the proposals and comment fixing its position on the proposals of the speakers or raising their own alternatives.


There is a brief introductory video to how to create your first debate:
